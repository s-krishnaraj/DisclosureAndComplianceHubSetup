            1. The objective of this [draft] Standard is to specify Disclosure Requirements which will enable users of sustainability statements to understand:
			<ol class="slds-list--ordered">
				<li>how the undertaking affects climate change, in terms of material positive and negative actual and potential impacts; </li>
				<li>the undertaking’s past, current, and future mitigation efforts in line with the Paris Agreement (or an updated international agreement on climate change) and limiting global warming to 1.5°C;</li>
				<li>the plans and capacity of the undertaking to adapt its strategy business model(s) and in line with the transition to a sustainable economy and to contribute to limiting global warming to 1.5°C;</li>
				<li>any other actions taken by the undertaking, and the result of such actions to prevent, mitigate or remediate actual or potential negative impacts;</li>
				<li>the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on climate change, and how the undertaking manages them; and </li>
				<li>the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term time horizons of risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on climate change.</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			2. The requirements of this [draft] Standard take into account the requirements of related EU legislation and regulation (i.e., EU Climate Law, Climate Benchmark Standards Regulation, Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), EU Taxonomy, and EBA Pillar 3disclosure requirements).<br><br>
			3. This [draft] Standard covers Disclosure Requirements related to the following sustainability matters: “Climate change mitigation”, “Climate change adaptation” and “Energy”. <br><br>
			4. Climate change mitigation relates to the undertaking’s endeavours to the general process of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1,5 °C above pre-industrial levels, as laid down in the Paris Agreement. This [draft] Standard covers disclosure requirements related but not limited to the seven Greenhouse Gases (GHG) carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PCFs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). It also covers Disclosure Requirements on how the undertaking addresses its GHG emissions as well as the associated transition risks. <br><br>
			5. “Climate change adaptation” relates to the undertaking’s process of adjustment to actual and expected climate change.<br><br>
			6. This [draft] Standard covers Disclosure Requirements regarding climate-related hazards that can lead to physical climate risks for the undertaking and its adaptation solutions to reduce these risks. It also covers transition risks arising from the needed adaptation to climate-related hazards.<br><br>
			7. The requirements related to “Energy” cover all types of energy production and consumption.<br><br>

        58. In addition to reporting on its gross GHG emission reduction targets as required in Disclosure Requirement E1-4 and possibly on its net zero targets in line with paragraph 57, the undertaking may have made public claims of GHG neutrality that involve the use of carbon credits by reference to the information disclosed under paragraph 53(b). In such a case, the undertaking shall explain the credibility and integrity of the carbon credits used, and whether and how its claims of GHG neutrality neither impede nor reduce the achievement of its GHG emission reduction targets.<a class="tooltip-wrap"><sup>10</sup>
