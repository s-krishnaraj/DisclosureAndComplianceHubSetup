            1. The objective of this [draft] Standard is to specify Disclosure Requirements which will enable users of the sustainability statements to understand:
			<ol class="slds-list--ordered">
				<li>how the undertaking affects water and marine resources, in terms of materialpositive and negative actual or potential impacts;</li>
				<li>any actions taken, and the result of such actions to prevent or mitigate material actual or potential negative impacts and to protect water and marine resources, also with reference to reduction of water consumption;</li>
				<li>whether, how and to what extent the undertaking is contributing to the European Green Deal’s ambitions for fresh air, clean water, a healthy soil and biodiversity as well as to ensuring the sustainability of the blue economy and fisheries sectors. Other initiatives include: the EU water framework directive, the EU marine strategy framework, the EU maritime spatial planning directive, the SDGs 6 Clean water and sanitation and 14 Life below water, and respect of global environmental limits (e.g. the biosphere integrity, ocean acidification, freshwater use, and biogeochemical flows planetary boundaries) in line with the vision for 2050 of“living well within the ecological limits of our planet” set out in the 7th Environmental Action Programme, and in the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and the Council on the 8th Environmental Action Programme; </li>
				<li>the plans and capacity of the undertaking to adapt its strategy and business model(s) s in line with the preservation and restoration of water and marine resources globally; </li>
				<li>the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on water and marine resources, and how the undertaking manages them; and</li>
				<li>the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-termtime horizons of material risks and opportunities arising from (i.e., those related to the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on water and marine resources).</li>
			</ol>
			<br><br>
				
			2. This [draft] Standard sets outs Disclosure Requirements related to water and marine resources. The sustainability matter ´water´ covers the undertaking’s relationship with water in its own operations, upstream and downstream value chain, in terms of impacts, risks and opportunities and how it effectively addresses these issues. Water covers surface water, groundwater and produced water. This covers where and how much water is consumed for the undertaking’s activities, products and services and what are the water-related impacts caused or contributed to by the undertaking. It also covers how the undertaking is exposed to water-related risks.<br><br>
			
			3. The sustainability matter “marine resources” covers the undertaking’s relationship with marine resources in its own operations, upstream and downstream value chain, in terms of impacts, risks and opportunities and how it effectively addresses these issues. These cover the use of ocean-based resources, discharges and emissions to the environment which end up in the oceans, or activities located in maritime (naval matters) areas.<br><br>
