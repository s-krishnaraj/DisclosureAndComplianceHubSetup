		1. This [draft] ESRS sets out the disclosure requirements that apply to all undertakings regardless of their sector of activity (i.e., sector agnostic) and apply across sustainability topics (i.e., cross-cutting). This [draft] ESRS covers the reporting areas defined in [draft] ESRS 1 General requirements section 1.2 Cross-Cutting Standards and reporting areas.<br><br>

		2. In the preparation of disclosures under this [draft] Standard, the undertaking shall apply the Disclosure Requirements (including their datapoints) set in [draft] topical ESRS, as listed in Appendix D Disclosure/Application Requirements in [draft] topical ESRS that are applicable jointly with [draft] ESRS 2 General Disclosures of this [draft] Standard. The undertaking shall apply these requirements: 
			<ol class="slds-list--ordered">
				<li> in all instances for:</li>
				<ol class="slds-is-nested">
					<li> those in [draft] ESRS E1 Climate change; and</li>
					<li> those in other topical standards to Disclosure Requirement IRO 1 Description of the processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities; and</li>
				</ol>
				<li> For those in other [draft] topical Standards, if, based on the undertaking’s materiality assessment (see [draft] ESRS 1 chapter 3 Double materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures), the sustainability topic concerned is material.</li>
