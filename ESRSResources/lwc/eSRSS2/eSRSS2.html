        <summary>Objective</summary>
        <div>
       1. The objective of this [draft] Standard is to specify disclosure requirements which will enable users of the sustainability statements to understand material impacts on value chain workers caused or contributed to by the undertaking, as well as material impacts which are directly linked to the undertaking’s own operations, products or services through its business relationships and its related material risks and opportunities, including:
       <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
            <li>how the undertaking affects workers in its value chain, in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts;</li>
            <li> any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent, mitigate or remediate actual or potential negative impacts;</li>
            <li> the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities related to its impacts and dependencies on workers in the value chain, and how the undertaking manages them; and</li>
            <li> the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term time horizons of material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on workers in the value chain.</li>
        </ol>
		<br>
		2. In order to meet the objective, this [draft] Standard requires an explanation of the general approach the undertaking takes to identify and manage any material actual and potential impacts on value chain workers in relation to:
        <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
        <li> working conditions (for example, secure employment, working time, adequate wages, social dialogue, freedom of association, including the existence of work councils, collective bargaining, work-life balance and health and safety);</li>
		<li> equal treatment and opportunities for all (for example, gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value, training and skills development, theemployment and inclusion of persons with disabilities, measures against violence and harassment in the workplace, and diversity);</li>
        <li> other work-related rights (for example, child labour, forced labour, adequate housing, water and sanitation and privacy).</li>
        </ol>
		<br>
		3. This [draft] Standard also requires an explanation of how such impacts, as well as the undertaking’s dependencies on value chain workers, can create material risks or opportunities for the undertaking. For example, negative impacts on value chain workers may disrupt the undertaking’s operations (through customers refusing to buy its products or state agencies impounding its goods) and harm its reputation. Conversely, respect for workers’ rights and active support programmes (for example through financial literacy initiatives) can bring business opportunities, such as more reliable supply or widening of the future consumer base.<br><br>
		4. This [draft] Standard covers all workers in the undertaking’s upstream and downstream value chain who are or can be materially impacted by the undertaking, this includes impacts that are caused or contributed to by the undertaking and those which are directly linked to its own operations, products, or services through its business relationships. This includes all workers who are not included in the scope of “own workforce” (“own workforce” includes employees, individual contractors, i.e., self-employed workers, and workers provided by third party undertakings primarily engaged in ‘employment activities’). Own workforce is covered in ESRS S1 Own workforce. See AR 3 for examples of what is included in the scope of this [draft] Standard.

Channels for raising concerns or needs include grievance mechanisms, hotlines, trade unions (where workers are unionised), dialogue processes or other means through which value chain workers or their legitimate representatives can raise concerns about impacts or explain needs that they would like the undertaking to address. This could include both channels provided by the undertaking directly and channels provided by the entities where the value chain workers are working, and are to be disclosed in addition to any other mechanisms the undertaking may use to gain insight into the management of impacts on workers, such as compliance audits. Where the undertaking is relying solely on information about the existence of such channels provided by its business relationships to answer this requirement, it may state that.<br><br>
        AR 24. To provide greater insight into the information covered in Disclosure Requirement ESRS S2-3, the undertaking may provide insight into whether and how value chain workers that may be affected are able to access channels at the level of the undertaking they are employed by, or contracted to work for, in relation to each material impact.<br><br>
        AR 25. Third party mechanisms could include those operated by the government, NGOs, industry associations and other collaborative initiatives. With regard to the scope of these mechanisms, the undertaking may disclose whether these are accessible to all workers who may be potentially or actually materially impacted by the undertaking, or individuals or organisations acting on their behalf or who are otherwise in a position to be aware of negative impacts, and through which value chain workers (or individuals or organisations acting on their behalf or who are otherwise in a position to be aware of negative impacts), can raise complaints or concerns related to the undertaking’s own activities.<br><br>
        AR 26. In relation to the protection of individuals that use the mechanisms against the retaliation, the undertaking may describe whether it treats grievances confidentially and with respect to the rights of privacy and data protection; and whether they allow for workers to use them anonymously (for example, through representation by a third party).<br><br>
        AR 27. In disclosing whether and how the undertaking knows that value chain workers are aware of and trust any of these channels, the undertaking may provide relevant and reliable data about the effectiveness of these channels from the perspective of value chain workers themselves. Examples of sources of information are surveys of workers that have used such channels and their levels of satisfaction with the process and outcomes.<br><br>
        AR 28. In describing the effectiveness of channels for value chain workers to raise concerns, the undertaking may be guided by the following questions, based on the “effectiveness criteria for non-judicial grievance mechanisms”, as laid out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The below considerations may be applied to individual channels or to a collective system of channels:
		<ol class="slds-list--ordered">
           <li> do the channels hold legitimacy by providing appropriate accountability for their fair conduct and building stakeholder trust?</li>
           <li> are the channels known and accessible to stakeholders?</li>
           <li> do the channels have clear and known procedures, with indicative timeframes?</li>
           <li> do the channels ensure reasonable access for stakeholders to sources of information, advice and expertise?</li>
           <li> do the channels offer transparency by providing sufficient information both to complainants and, where applicable, to meet any public interest?</li>
           <li> do outcomes achieved through the channels accord with internationally recognised human rights?</li>
           <li> does the undertaking identify insights from the channels that support continuous learning in both improving the channels and preventing future impacts?</li>
           <li> does the undertaking focus on dialogue with complainants as the means to reach agreed solutions, rather than seeking to unilaterally determine the outcome?</li>

		AR 30. It may take time to understand negative impacts and how the undertaking may be involved with them through its value chain, as well as to identify appropriate responses and put them into practice. Therefore, the undertaking shall consider:
		<ol class="slds-list--ordered">
           <li> its general and specific approaches to addressing material negative impacts;</li>
           <li> its initiatives aimed at contributing to additional material positive impacts;</li>
           <li> how far it has progressed in its efforts during the reporting period; and</li>
           <li> its aims for continued improvement.</li>
		</ol>
		<br>
        AR 31. Appropriate action can vary according to whether the undertaking causes or contributes to a material impact or whether the material impact is directly linked to its own operations, products or services through a business relationship.<br><br>
        AR 32. Given that material negative impacts affecting value chain workers that have occurred during the reporting period may not be caused or contributed to by the undertaking alone and may be linked to entities or operations outside its direct control, the undertaking may disclose whether and how it seeks to use its leverage with relevant business relationships to manage those impacts. This may include using commercial leverage (for example, enforcing contractual requirements with business relationships or implementing incentives), other forms of leverage within the relationship (such as providing training or capacity-building on workers’ rights to business relationships) or collaborative leverage with peers or other actors (such as initiatives aimed at responsible recruitment or ensuring workers receive a living wage).<br><br>
        AR 33. When the undertaking discloses its participation in an industry or multi-stakeholder initiative as part of its actions to address material negative impacts, the undertaking may disclose how the initiative, and its own involvement, is aiming to address the material impact concerned. It may disclose under ESRS S2-5 the relevant targets set by the initiative and progress towards them.<br><br>
        AR 34. When disclosing whether and how the undertaking considers actual and potential impacts on value chain workers in decisions to terminate business relationships and whether and how it seeks to address any negative impacts that may result from termination, the undertaking may include examples.<br><br>
        AR 35. In disclosing how it tracks the effectiveness of its actions to manage material impacts during the reporting period, the undertaking may disclose any lessons learned from the previous and current reporting periods.<br><br>
        AR 36. Processes used to track the effectiveness of actions can include internal or external auditing or verification, court proceedings and/or related court decisions, impact assessments, measurement systems, stakeholder feedback, grievance mechanisms, external performance ratings, and benchmarking.<br><br>
        AR 37. Reporting on effectiveness is aimed at enabling the understanding of the links between actions taken by the undertaking and the effective management of impacts. For example, to show the effectiveness of its actions to support its suppliers with improving their working conditions, the undertaking may disclose survey feedback from the suppliers’ workers showing that working conditions have improved since the time the undertaking began working with those suppliers. Additional information that the undertaking may provide includes data showing a decrease in the number of incidents identified through for instance independent audits.<br><br>
        AR 38. With regard to initiatives or processes the undertaking has in place that are based on affected workers’ needs and their level of implementation, the undertaking may disclose:
		<ol class="slds-list--ordered">
           <li> information about whether and how value chain workers and legitimate representatives or their credible proxies play a role in decisions regarding the design and implementation of these programmes or processes; and</li>
           <li> information about the intended or achieved positive outcomes for value chain workers of these initiatives or processes.</li>
		</ol>
		<br>
        AR 39. The undertaking may disclose whether any initiatives or processes whose primary aim is to deliver positive impacts for value chain workers are designed also to support the achievement of one or more of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For example, through a commitment to advance UN SDG 8 to “promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all” the undertaking may be providing capacity-building to smallholders in its supply chain, resulting in increases in their income; or it may be supporting training to increase the proportion of women able to take delivery jobs in its downstream value chain.<br><br>
        AR 40. When disclosing the intended or achieved positive outcomes of its actions for value chain workers a distinction is to be made between evidence of certain activities having occurred (e.g., that x number of workers have received financial literacy training) from evidence of actual outcomes for workers (e.g., that x workers report that they are able to better manage their household budgets so as to meet their savings goals).<br><br>
        AR 41. When disclosing whether initiatives or processes also play a role in mitigating material negative impacts, the undertaking may e.g., consider programmes that aim to advance women workers’ financial literacy that have resulted in more women being promoted as well as in reports of reduced sexual harassment in the workplace.<br><br>
        AR 42. When disclosing the material risks and opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts or dependencies on value chain workers, the undertaking may consider the following business risks that could lead into material risks and business opportunities:
		<ol class="slds-list--ordered">
           <li> business risks related to the undertaking’s impacts on value chain workers may include the reputational or legal exposure where value chain workers are found to be subject to forced or child labour;</li>
           <li> business risks related to the undertaking’s dependencies on value chain workers may include the loss of business continuity where a pandemic closes significant parts of its supply chain or distribution network;</li>
           <li> business opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts on value chain workers may include market differentiation and greater customer appeal from guaranteeing decent pay and conditions for its gig workers; and</li>
           <li> business opportunities related to the undertaking’s dependencies on value chain workers might include the achievement of a future sustainable supply of a commodity by ensuring smallholder farmers earn enough to persuade future generations to keep farming that crop.</li>
		</ol>
		<br>
        AR 43. When disclosing whether dependencies turn into risks, the undertaking shall consider external developments.<br><br>
        AR 44. When disclosing policies, action and resources and targets related to the management of material risks and opportunities, in cases where risks and opportunities arise from a material impact, the undertaking may cross-reference its disclosures on policies, action and resources and targets in relation to that impact.<br><br>
        AR 45. The undertaking shall consider the extent to which its process(es) to manage material risks related to value chain workers are integrated into its existing risk management process(es) and how.<br><br>
        AR 46. When disclosing the resources allocated to the management of material impacts, the undertaking may disclose which internal functions are involved in managing the impacts and what types of action they take to address negative and advance positive impacts.<br><br>

        <div id='divS2-5AR'>
		AR 47. When disclosing the targets, the undertaking shall consider disclosing, where applicable:
		<ol class="slds-list--ordered">
           <li> the intended outcomes to be achieved in the lives of value chain workers, being asspecific as possible;</li>
           <li> that these are measurable/verifiable;</li>
           <li> their stability over time in terms of definitions and methodologies to enable comparability over time;</li>
           <li> references to standards or commitments which the targets are based (for instance code of conducts, sourcing policies, global frameworks or industry codes).</li>
		</ol>
		<br>
        AR 48. Targets related to material risks and opportunities may be the same as or distinct from targets tied to material impacts. Therefore, no distinction is to be made per se, but what the target is aiming at is to be disclosed (i.e., material impact and/or risks and opportunities). For example, a target to reach living wages for supply chain workers could both reduce impacts on those workers and reduce associated business risks in terms of the quality and reliability of supply.<br><br>
        AR 49. The undertaking may also distinguish between short-, medium- and long-term targets covering the same policy commitment. For example, the undertaking may have a long-term target to achieve an 80% reduction in health and safety incidents affecting its delivery drivers by 2030 and a near-term target to reduce the overtime hours of delivery drivers by x% while maintaining their income by 2024.<br><br>
        AR 50. When modifying or replacing a target in the reporting period, the undertaking may explain the change by cross-referencing it to significant changes in the business model(s) or to broader changes in the accepted standard or legislation from which the target is derived to provide contextual information, as per ESRS 2 BP-2 Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances.<br><br>
