        <summary>Objective</summary>
             <div>
                1. The objective of this [draft] Standard is to specify disclosure requirements which will enable users of the sustainability statements to understand material impacts on consumers and/or end-users caused or contributed by the undertaking, as well as material impacts which are directly linked to the undertaking’s own operations, products or services through its business relationships and its related material risks and opportunities, including:
             <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
             <li>how the undertaking affects the consumers and/or end-users of its products and/or services (referred to in this [draft] Standard as “consumers and end-users”), in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts;</li>
             <li>any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent, mitigate or remediate actual or potential negative impacts;</li>
             <li>the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities related to its impacts and dependencies on consumers and/or end-users, and how the undertaking manages them; and</li>
             <li>the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term time horizons of material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencieson consumers and/or end-users.</li>
              </ol><br>
            2. In order to meet the objective, this [draft] Standard requires an explanation of the general approach the undertaking takes to identify and manage any material actual and potential impacts on the consumers and/or end-users related to its products and/or services in relation to:
             <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
                <li>information-related impacts for consumers and/or end-users (for example, privacy, freedom of expression and access to (quality) information;</li>
                <li>personal safety of consumers and/or end-users (for example, health and safety, security of a person and protection of children);</li>
                <li>social inclusion of consumers and/or end-users (for example, non-discrimination, access to products and services and responsible marketing practices).</li>
                </ol>
               <br> 
            3. This [draft] Standard also requires an explanation of how such impacts, as well as the undertaking’s dependencies on consumers and/or end-users, can create material risks or opportunities for the undertaking. For example, negative impacts on the reputation of the undertaking’s products and/or services can deteriorate its business performance, while trust in products and/or services can bring business benefits, such as increased sales or widening of the future consumer base.<br><br>
            4. This [draft] standard applies when material impacts on and/or material risks and opportunities related to consumers and/or end-users have been identified through the materiality assessment process laid out in ESRS 2 General disclosures.<br><br>
            5. This [draft] Standard shall be read in conjunction with ESRS 1 General requirements, and ESRS 2,as well as ESRS S1 Own workforce, ESRS S2 Workers in the value chain and ESRS S3 Affected communities.<br><br>

        AR 23. In disclosing whether and how the undertaking knows that consumers and/or end-users are aware of and trust any of these channels, the undertaking may provide relevant and reliable data about the effectiveness of these channels from the perspective of consumers and/or end-users themselves. Examples of sources of information are surveys of consumers and/or end-users that have used such channels and their levels of satisfaction with the process and outcomes. To illustrate the usage level of such channels, the undertaking may disclose the number of complaints received from consumers and/or end-users during the reporting period.<br><br>
        AR 24. In describing the effectiveness of channels for consumers and/or end-users to raise concerns, the, undertaking may be guided by the following questions, based on the “effectiveness criteria for nonjudicial grievance mechanisms”, as laid out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The below considerations may be applied on an individual channel basis or for the collective system of channels:
        <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
            <li>do the channels hold legitimacy by providing appropriate accountability for their fair conduct and building stakeholder trust?</li>

            <li>do the channels have known procedures, set timeframes and clarity on the processes?</li>
            <li>do the channels ensure reasonable access to sources of information, advice and expertise?</li>
            <li>do the channels offer transparency by providing sufficient information both to complainants and where applicable, to meet any public interest at stake?</li>
            <li>do the outcomes achieved from the channels accord with internationally recognised human rights?</li>
            <li>does the undertaking identify insights from the channels that support continuous learning in both improving the channels and preventing future impacts?</li>
            <li>does the undertaking focus on dialogue with complainants as the means to reach agreed solutions, rather than seeking to unilaterally determine the outcome?</li></ol><br>

		AR 25. It may take time to understand negative impacts and how the undertaking may be involved with them through its downstream value chain, as well as to identify appropriate responses and put them into practice). Therefore, the undertaking shall consider:
        <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
            <li>Its general and specific approaches to addressing material negative impacts;</li>
            <li>its initiatives aimed at contributing to additional material positive impacts;</li>
            <li>how far it has progressed in its efforts during the reporting period; and</li>
            <li>its aims for continued improvement.</li></ol><br>
        AR 26. Appropriate action can vary according to whether the undertaking causes or contributes to a material impact, or whether the material impact is directly linked to its own operations, products or services through a business relationship.<br><br>
        AR 27. Given that material negative impacts affecting consumers and/or end-users that have occurred during the reporting period may not be caused or contributed by the undertaking alone and may be linked to entities or operations outside its direct control, the undertaking may disclose whether and how it seeks to use leverage with relevant business relationships to manage those impacts. This may include using commercial leverage (for example, enforcing contractual requirements with business relationships or implementing incentives), other forms of leverage within the relationship (such as providing training or capacity-building on proper product use or sale practices to business relationships) or collaborative leverage with peers or other actors (such as initiatives aimed at responsible marketing or product safety).<br><br>
        AR 28. When the undertaking discloses its participation in an industry or multi-stakeholder initiative as part of its actions to address material negative impacts, the undertaking may disclose how the initiative, and its own involvement, is aiming to address the material impact concerned. It may disclose under ESRS S4-5 the relevant targets set by the initiative and progress towards them.<br><br>
        AR 29. When disclosing whether and how it considers actual and potential impacts on consumers and/or end-users in decisions to terminate business relationships and whether and how it seeks to address any negative impacts that may result from termination, the undertaking may include examples.<br><br>
        AR 30. In disclosing how it tracks the effectiveness of actions to manage material impacts during the reporting period, the undertaking may disclose any lessons learned from the previous and current reporting periods.<br><br>
        AR 31. Processes used to track the effectiveness of actions can include internal or external auditing orm verification, court proceedings and/or related court decisions, impact assessments, measurement systems, stakeholder feedback, grievance mechanisms, external performance ratings, and benchmarking.<br><br>
        AR 32. Reporting on effectiveness is aimed at enabling the understanding of the links between actions taken by the undertaking and the effective management of impacts.<br><br>
        AR 33. With regard to initiatives or processes the undertaking has in place that are based on affected consumers and/or end-users’ needs and their level of implementation, the undertaking may disclose:
        <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
            <li>information about whether and how consumers and/or end-users and legitimate representatives or their credible proxies play a role in decisions regarding the design and implementation of these programmes or processes; and</li>
            <li>information about the intended or achieved positive outcomes for consumers and/or endusers of these programmes or processes.</li></ol><br>
        AR 34. The undertaking may disclose whether any initiatives or processes whose primary aim is to deliver positive impacts for consumers and/or end-users are designed to also support the achievement of one or more of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For example, through a commitment to advance UN SDG 3 to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages” the undertaking may be actively working to make its products less addictive and harmful to physical and psychological health, which can benefit both the consumers and/or end-users themselves, but also their families and communities.<br><br>
        AR 35. When disclosing the intended positive outcomes of its actions for consumers and/or end-users a distinction is to be made between evidence of certain activities having occurred (for example, that x number of consumers have received information about healthy eating habits) from evidence of actual outcomes for consumers and/or end-users (for example, that x number of consumers have changed their eating habits and improved their overall health).<br><br>
        AR 36. When disclosing whether initiatives of processes also play a role in mitigating material negative impacts, the undertaking may, for example, consider programmes that aim to support heightened digital awareness of the risk of online scams, that have led to a reduction in the number of cases of end-users experiencing breaches of data privacy.<br><br>
        AR 37. When disclosing the material risks and opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts or dependencies on consumers and/or end-users, the undertaking may consider the following business risks that could lead into material risks and business opportunities:
        <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
            <li>business risks related to the undertaking’s impacts on consumers and/or end-users may include the reputational or legal exposure where poorly designed or defective products result in injuries or deaths;</li>
            <li>business risks related to the undertaking’s dependencies on consumers and/or end-users may include the loss of business continuity where an economic crisis makes consumers unable to afford certain products or services;</li>
            <li>business opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts on consumers and/or endusers may include market differentiation and greater customer appeal from offering safe products or privacy-respecting services; and</li>
            <li>business opportunities related to the undertaking’s dependencies on consumers and/or end-users may include the achievement of a loyal future consumer base by ensuring, for example, that LGBTQI communities are respected and included in the products or services offered by the undertaking.</li></ol><br>
        AR 38. When disclosing whether dependencies turn into risks, the undertaking shall consider external developments.<br><br>
        AR 39. When disclosing policies, action and resources and targets related to the management of material risks and opportunities, in cases where risks and opportunities arise from a material impact, the undertaking may cross-reference its disclosures on policies, action and resources and targets in relation to that impact.<br><br>
        AR 40. The undertaking shall consider the extent to which its processes to manage material risks related to consumers and/or end-users are integrated into its existing risk management processes and how.<br><br>
        AR 41. When disclosing the resources allocated to the management of material impacts, the undertaking may disclose which internal functions are involved in managing the impacts and what types of action they take to address negative and advance positive impacts.<br><br>

		AR 42. When disclosing targets in relation to consumers and/or end-users, the undertaking shall consider disclosing, where applicable:
        <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
            <li>the intended outcomes to be achieved in the lives of consumers and/or end-users, being as specific as possible;</li>
            <li>that these are measurable/verifiable;</li>
            <li>their stability over time in terms of definitions and methodologies to enable comparability; and/or</li>
            <li>references standards or commitments on which the targets are based are to be clearly defined in the reporting (for instance code of conducts, sourcing policies, global frameworks or industry codes).</li></ol><br>
        AR 43. Targets related to material risks and opportunities may be the same as or distinct from targets tied to material impacts. Therefore, no distinction is to be made per se, but what the target is aiming at is to be disclosed (i.e., material impact and/or risks and opportunities)". For example, a target to ensure equal access to finance for underserved consumers could both reduce discrimination impacts on those consumers and enlarge the undertaking’s pool of customers.<br><br>
        AR 44. The undertaking may also distinguish between short, medium and long-term targets covering the same policy commitment. For example, the undertaking may have as a main objective to make its online services accessible to people with disabilities, with the long-term goal of having adapted 100% of its online services by 2025, and with the short-term objective of adding x number of accessible features every year up and until 2025.<br><br>
        AR 45. When modifying or replacing a target in the reporting period, the undertaking may explain the change by cross-referencing it to significant changes in the business model(s) or to broader changes in the accepted standard or legislation from which the target is derived to provide contextual information as per ESRS 2 BP-2 Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances.<br><br>
