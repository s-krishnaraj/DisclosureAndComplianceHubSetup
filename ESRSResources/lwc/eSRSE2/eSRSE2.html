            1. The objective of this [draft] Standard is to specify Disclosure Requirements which will enable users of the sustainability statements to understand:
            <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
				<li>how the undertaking affects pollution of air, water and soil, in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts;</li>
				<li>any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent or mitigate actual or potential material negative impacts;</li>
				<li>the plans and capacity of the undertaking to adapt its strategy and business model(s) in line with the transition to a sustainable economy concurring with the needs for prevention, control and elimination of pollution. This is to create a toxic-free environment with zero pollution also in support of the EU Action Plan “Towards a Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil”; </li>
				<li>the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities related to the undertaking’s pollution-related impacts and dependencies, as well as the prevention, control, elimination or reduction of pollution (including from regulations) and how the undertaking manages this; and </li>
				<li>the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term time horizons of material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s pollution-related impacts and dependencies.</li>
            </ol>
			<br>
			2. This [draft] Standard sets out Disclosure Requirements related to the following sustainability matters: pollution of air, water, soil, substances of concern, including substances of very high concern.<br><br>
			
			3. The sustainability matter “pollution of air” covers information related to the undertaking’s emissions into air (both indoor and outdoor), and prevention, control and reduction of such emissions and thus pollution.<br><br>
			
			4. The sustainability matter “pollution of water” covers information related to the undertaking’s emissions to water, and prevention, control and reduction of such emissions and therebypollution. <br><br>
			
			5. The sustainability matter “pollution of soil” covers information related to the undertaking’s emissions into soil and the prevention, control and reduction of such emissions and thereby pollution. <br><br>
			
			6. The sustainability matter “substances of concern” cover information related to the undertaking’s production, use and/or distribution and commercialisation of substances of concern, including substances of very high concern. Such Disclosure Requirements aim at providing users with an understanding of actual or potential impacts from their use and/or distribution and commercialisation in a context of possible restrictions towards their use and/or distribution and commercialisation.<br><br>
