             <div>
                1. The objective of this [draft] Standard is to specify disclosure requirements which will enable users of the sustainability statements to understand material impacts on affected communities caused or contributed to by the undertaking, as well as, material impacts which are directly linked to the undertaking’s own operations, products or services through its business relationships and its related material risks and opportunities, including:
            <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
             <li>how the undertaking affects communities, in areas where risks are most likely to be present and severe, in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts;</li>
             <li>any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent, mitigate or remediate actual or potential negative impacts;</li>
             <li>the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities related to its impacts and dependencies on affected communities, and how the undertaking manages them; and</li>
             <li>the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term time horizons of material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on affected communities.</li>
              </ol><br>
            2. In order to meet the objective, this [draft] Standard requires an explanation of the general approach the undertaking takes to identify and manage any material actual and potential impacts on affected communities in relation to:
             <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
                <li> communities’ economic, social and cultural rights (for example, adequate housing, adequate food, water and sanitation, land-related and security-related impacts);</li>
                <li>communities’ civil and political rights (for example, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, impacts on human rights defenders); and</li>
                <li>particular rights of indigenous communities (for example, free, prior and informed consent, self-determination, cultural rights).</li>
                </ol>
               <br> 
            3. This [draft] Standard also requires an explanation of how such impacts, as well as the undertaking’s dependencies on affected communities, can create material risks or opportunities for the undertaking. For example, negative relationships with affected communities may disrupt the undertaking’s own operations or harm its reputation, while constructive relationships can bring business benefits, such as stable and conflict-free operations and a greater ease of recruiting locally.<br><br>
            4. This [draft] standard applies when material impacts on and/or material risks and opportunities related to affected communities have been identified through the materiality assessment process laid out in ESRS 2 General disclosures.<br><br>
            5.This [draft] Standard shall be read in conjunction with ESRS 1 General requirements, and ESRS 2, as well as the ESRS S1 Own workforce, ESRS S2 Workers in the value chain and ESRS S4 Consumers and end-users.<br><br>

In relation to the protection of individuals that use the mechanisms against the retaliation, the undertaking may describe whether it treats grievances confidentially and with respect to the rights of privacy and data protection; and whether they allow for communities to use them anonymously (for example, through representation by a third party).<br><br>
        AR 25. When disclosing processes related to the provision of and enabling remedy for indigenous peoples, relevant information includes whether and how the undertaking has considered their customs, traditions, rules and legal systems.<br><br>
        AR 26. In disclosing whether and how the undertaking knows that affected communities are aware of and trust any of these channels, the undertaking may provide relevant and reliable data about the effectiveness of these channels from the perspective of affected communities themselves. Examples of sources of information are surveys of community members that have used such channels and their levels of satisfaction with the process and outcomes.<br><br>
        AR 27. In describing the effectiveness of channels for affected communities to raise concerns, the undertaking may be guided by the following questions, based on the “effectiveness criteria for nonjudicial grievance mechanisms”, as laid out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The below considerations may be applied on an individual channel basis or for the collective system of channels:
        <ol class="slds-list--ordered">

            <li>do the channels have clear and known procedures, set timeframes and clarity on the processes?</li>
            <li>do the channels ensure reasonable access to sources of information, advice and expertise?</li>
            <li>do the channels offer transparency by providing sufficient information both to complainants and, where applicable, to meet any public interest at stake?</li>
            <li>do the outcomes achieved through the channels accord with internationally recognised human rights?</li>

            <li>its general and specific approaches to addressing material negative impacts;</li>
            <li>its social investment or other development programmes aimed at contributing to additional material positive impacts;</li>
            <li>how far it has progressed in its efforts during the reporting period; and</li>
            <li>its aims for continued improvement</li></ol><br>
        AR 29. Appropriate action can vary according to whether the undertaking causes or contributes to a material impact, or whether the material impact is directly linked to its own operations, products or services through a business relationship.<br><br>
        AR 30. Given that material negative impacts affecting communities that have occurred during the reporting period may not be caused or contributed to by the undertaking alone and may be linked to entities or operations outside its direct control, the undertaking may disclose whether and how it seeks to use its leverage with relevant business relationships to manage those impacts. This may include using commercial leverage (for example, enforcing contractual requirements with business relationships or implementing incentives), other forms of leverage within the relationship (such as providing training or capacity-building on indigenous rights to business relationships) or collaborative leverage with peers or other actors (such as initiatives aimed at minimising security-related impacts on communities or participating in company-community partnerships).<br><br>
        AR 31. Impacts on communities may stem from environmental matters which are disclosed by the undertaking under the [draft] ESRS E1 to E5. Examples include:
        <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
            <li>[draft] ESRS E1 Climate Change: The implementation of climate change mitigation plans may require the undertaking to invest in renewable energy projects that may affect the lands, territories and natural resources of indigenous people. If the undertaking does not consult with the affected indigenous community, it could negatively impact the affected communities’ right to free, prior and informed consent;</li>
            <li>[draft] ESRS E2 Pollution: The undertaking may negatively impact affected communities by , for example, failing to protect them from polluting production plants, that cause them health-related issues;</li>
            <li>[draft] ESRS E3 Water and marine sources: The undertaking may negatively impact the access to clean drinking water of communities by failing to manage polluting emissions or when operating and withdrawing water in water stressed areas;</li>
            <li>[draft] ESRS E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems: The undertaking may negatively affect the livelihood of local farmers through, for example, operations that contaminate soil. Additional examples include the sealing of land through building new infrastructure, which can eradicate plant species that are critical for, for example, local biodiversity or to filter water for communities; or the introduction of invasive species (whether plants or animals) that can impact ecosystems and cause subsequent harm;</li>
            <li>[draft] ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy: The undertaking may negatively impact the lives of communities by affecting their health through the mis-management of hazardous waste. Where the connection between environmental impacts and local communities is addressed in the disclosures within the Disclosure Requirements ESRS E1-E5, the undertaking may cross-reference to those and clearly identify such disclosures.</li></ol><br>
        AR 32. When the undertaking discloses its participation in an industry or multi-stakeholder initiative as part of its actions to address material negative impacts, the undertaking may disclose how the initiative, and its own involvement, is aiming to address the material impact concerned. It may disclose under ESRS S3-5 the relevant targets set by the initiative and progress towards them.<br><br>
        AR 33. When disclosing whether and how the undertaking considers actual and potential impacts on affected communities in decisions to terminate business relationships and whether and how it seeks to address any negative impacts that may result from termination, the undertaking may include examples.<br><br>
        AR 34. In disclosing how it tracks the effectiveness of actions to manage material impacts during the reporting period, the undertaking may disclose any lessons learned from the previous and current reporting periods.<br><br>
        AR 35. Processes used to track the effectiveness of actions can include internal or external auditing or verification, court proceedings and/or related court decisions, impact assessments, measurement systems, stakeholder feedback, grievance mechanisms, external performance ratings, and benchmarking.<br><br>
        AR 36. Reporting on effectiveness is aimed at enabling the understanding of the links between actions taken by an undertaking and the effective management of impacts.<br><br>
        AR 37. With regard to initiatives or processes the undertaking has in place that are based on affected communities’ needs and their level of implementation, the undertaking may disclose:
        <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
            <li>information about whether and how affected communities and legitimate representatives or their credible proxies play a role in decisions regarding the design and implementation of these investments or programmes; and</li>
            <li>information about the intended or achieved positive outcomes for affected communities of these investments or programmes.</li>
            <li>an explanation of the approximate scope of affected communities covered by the described social investment or development programmes, and, where applicable, the rationale for why selected communities were chosen for a given social investment or development programme's implementation.</li></ol><br>
        AR 38. The undertaking may disclose whether any initiatives or processes whose primary aim is to deliver positive impacts for affected communities are designed also to support the achievement of one or more of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For example, through a commitment to advance UN SDG 5 to “achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls” the undertaking may be taking thoughtful measures to include women in the consultation process with an affected community to meet standards of effective stakeholder engagement, which can help empower the women in the process itself, but potentially also in their daily lives.<br><br>
        AR 39. When disclosing the intended or achieved positive outcomes of its actions for affected communities a distinction is to be made between evidence of certain activities having occurred (for example, that x number of women community members have been provided with training on how to become local suppliers to the undertaking,) from evidence of actual outcomes for affected communities (for example, that x women community members have set up small businesses and have had their contracts with the undertaking renewed year-on-year).<br><br>
        AR 40. When disclosing whether initiatives or processes also play a role in mitigating material negative impacts, the undertaking may for example consider programmes that aim to improve local infrastructure surrounding an undertaking’s operations, such as roads, that have led to a reduction in the number of severe traffic accidents involving community members.<br><br>
        AR 41. When disclosing the material risks and opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts or dependencies on affected communities, the undertaking may consider the following business risks that could lead into material risks and business opportunities:
        <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
            <li>business risks related to the undertaking’s impacts on affected communities may include the reputational or legal exposure, as well as operational risks, where affected communities protest against resettlements or the loss of access to lands, leading to costly delays, boycotts, or lawsuits;</li>
            <li>business risks related to the undertaking’s dependencies on affected communities may include the loss of business continuity where indigenous communities decide to withdraw their consent to a project on their lands, forcing the undertaking to significantly modify or abandon the project;</li>
            <li>business opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts on affected communities may include more easily financing projects and being a partner of choice for communities, governments and other businesses; and</li>
            <li>business opportunities related to the undertaking’s dependencies on affected communities may include the development of positive relationships between the undertaking and indigenous communities that enable existing projects to expand with strong support.</li></ol><br>
        AR 42. In disclosing the information above, the undertaking may consider explanations of business risks and opportunities stemming from environmental impacts or dependencies (please refer to AR 31 for further details), including related human rights (or social) impacts. Examples include reputational risks stemming from the impact on the health of communities of unmanaged polluting discharges; or the financial effects of protests that may disrupt or interrupt an undertaking’s activities, for example, in response to operations in water stressed areas that may impact the lives of affected communities.<br><br>
        AR 43. When disclosing whether dependencies turn into risks, the undertaking shall consider external developments.<br><br>
        AR 44. When disclosing policies, action and resources and targets related to the management of material risks and opportunities, in cases where risks and opportunities arise from a material impact, the undertaking may cross-reference its disclosures on policies, action and resources and targets in relation to that impact.<br><br>
        AR 45. The undertaking shall consider the extent to which its processes to manage material risks related to affected communities are integrated into its existing risk management processes and how.<br><br>
        AR 46. When disclosing the resources allocated to the management of material impacts, the undertaking may disclose which internal functions are involved in managing the impacts and what types of action they take to address negative and advance positive impacts.<br><br>

		AR 47. When disclosing the targets, the undertaking shall consider disclosing, where applicable:
        <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
            <li>the intended outcomes to be achieved in the lives of affected communities, being as specific as possible;</li>
            <li>that these are measurable/verifiable;</li>
            <li>their stability over time in terms of definitions and methodologies to enable comparability over time ;</li>
            <li>references to standards or commitments which the targets are based on are to be clearly defined in the reporting (for instance code of conducts, sourcing policies, global frameworks or industry codes).</li></ol><br>
        AR 48. Targets related to material risks and opportunities may be the same as or distinct from targets tied to material impacts. Therefore, no distinction is to be made per se, but what the target is aiming at is to be disclosed (i.e. material impact and/or risks and opportunities). For example, a target to fully restore livelihoods of affected communities following resettlement could both reduce impacts on those communities and reduce associated business risks such as community protests.<br><br>
        AR 49. The undertaking may also distinguish between short, medium and long-term targets covering the same policy commitment. For example, the undertaking may have as a main objective to employ community members at a local mining site, with the long-term goal of staffing 100% locally by 2025, and with the short-term objective of adding x percent of local employees every year up and until 2025.<br><br>
        AR 50. When modifying or replacing a target in the reporting period, the undertaking may explain the change by linking it to significant changes in the business model(s) or to broader changes in the accepted standard or legislation from which the target is derived to provide contextual information as per ESRS 2 BP-2 Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances.<br><br>
