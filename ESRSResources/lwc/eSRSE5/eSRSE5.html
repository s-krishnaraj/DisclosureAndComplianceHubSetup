            1. The objective of this [draft] Standard is to specify Disclosure Requirements which will enable users of the sustainability statements to understand:
        <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
         <li>how the undertaking affects resource use, including the depletion of non-renewable resources and the regenerative production of renewable resources (referred to in this [draft] Standard as “resource use and circular economy”) in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts;</li>
         <li>any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent or mitigate actual or potential material negative impacts arising from resource use and circular economy, including its measures to help decoupling its economic growth from the use of materials;</li>
         <li>the plans and capacity of the undertaking to adapt its strategy and business model(s) in line with circular economy principles including but not limited to minimising waste, maintaining the value of products, materials and other resources at their highest value and enhancing their efficient use in production and consumption;</li>
         <li>the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies, arising from resource use and circular economy, and how the undertaking manages them; and</li>
         <li>the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term time horizons of material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on resource use and circular economy.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        2. This [draft] Standard sets out Disclosure Requirements related to “resource use” and “circular economy” and in particular on:
         <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
            <li>resource inflows including the circularity of material resource inflows, considering renewable and non-renewable resources; and</li>
            <li>resource outflows including information on products and materials; and</li>
            <li>waste.</li>
            </ol>
           <br> 
        3. Circular economy means an economic system whereby the value of products, materials and other resources in the economy is maintained for as long as possible, enhancing their efficient use in production and consumption, thereby reducing the environmental impact of their use, minimising waste and the release of hazardous substances at all stages of their life cycle, including through the application of the waste hierarchy. The goal is to maximise and maintain the value of the resources, products and materials by creating a system that allows for renewability, long life optimal use or re-use, refurbishment, remanufacturing, recycling and biodegradation.<br><br>
        4. This [draft] Standard also builds on existing EU legislative frameworks and policies which are referred to in this [draft] Standard: the EU Green Deal, Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (SFDR), Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (the EU Taxonomy), EU Circular Economy Action Plan1, the Waste Framework directive and the EU industrial strategy.<br><br>
        5. To evaluate the transition from a “business as usual” to a circular economic system, this [draft]Standard relies on the identification of resources, materials and products physical flows used by the undertaking through Disclosure Requirement E5-4 Resource inflows and Disclosure Requirement E5-5 Resource outflows.<br><br>
        6. The topic resource use and circular economy is closely connected to other environmental matters such as climate change, pollution, water and marine resources and biodiversity. A circular economy is a system that tends towards a sustainable production and consumption. Such system brings multiple environmental benefits, in particular, the reduction of energy consumption and emissions into the air (greenhouse gas emissions or other pollution), the limitation of water withdrawals and discharges and the regeneration of nature limiting the impact on biodiversity.<br><br>
        7. Thus, to provide a comprehensive overview of which aspects of other environmental matters could be material to resource use and circular economy, relevant disclosure requirements are covered in other [draft] environmental ESRS as follows:
        <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
         <li>[draft] ESRS E1 Climate change, which addresses, in particular, GHG emissions and energy resources (energy consumption);</li>
         <li>[draft] ESRS E2 Pollution, which addresses, in particular, emissions to water, air and soilas well as substances of concern;</li>
         <li>[draft] ESRS E3 Water and marine resources, which addresses, in particular, waterresource (water consumption) and marine resources; and</li>
         <li>[draft] ESRS E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems, which addresses, in particular,ecosystems and species and raw materials.</li>
        </ol><br>
        8. This [draft] Standard covers an environmental topic, however as people benefit from nature, the undertaking’s impacts on nature affect communities. Material negative impacts on affected communities from resource use and circular economy related impacts attributable to the undertaking are covered in [draft] ESRS S3 Affected communities.<br><br>
        9. This [draft] Standard should be read in conjunction with [draft] ESRS 1 General requirementsand [draft] ESRS 2 General disclosures.<br><br>
