            1. The objective of this [draft] Standard is to specify disclosure requirements which will enable users of the sustainability statements to understand the undertaking’s material impacts on its workforce, as well as related material risks and opportunities, including:
                <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
	                <li> how the undertaking affects its own workforce, in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts; </li>
	                <li> any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent, mitigate or remediate actual or potential negative impacts;</li>
	                <li>the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities related to its impacts and dependencies on its own workforce, and how the undertaking manages them; and</li>
	                <li> the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term time horizons of material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on its own workforce.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
             2. In order to meet the objective, this [draft] Standard also requires an explanation of the general approach the undertaking takes to identify and manage any material actual and potential impacts on its own workforce in relation to the following social, including human rights, factors or matters:
                <ol class="slds-list--ordered">
		            <li> working conditions, including:</li>
		                <ol class="slds-is-nested">
		                	<li> secure employment;</li>
			                <li> working time; </li>
			                <li> adequate wages; </li>
			                <li> social dialogue;</li>
			                <li> freedom of association, the existence of works councils and the information, consultation and participation rights of workers;</li>
			                <li> collective bargaining, including the rate of workers covered by collective agreements;</li>
			                <li> work-life balance; and</li>
			                <li> health and safety.</li>
		                </ol>
		            <li> equal treatment and opportunities for all, including: </li>
		                <ol class="slds-is-nested">
			                <li> gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value;</li>
			                <li> training and skills development;</li>
			                <li> employment and inclusion of persons with disabilities; </li>
			                <li> measures against violence and harassment in the workplace; and</li>
			                <li> diversity.</li>
		                </ol>
		            <li>other work-related rights, including:</li>
		                <ol class="slds-is-nested">
			                <li> child labour; </li>
			                <li> forced labour;</li>
			                <li> adequate housing; and</li>
			                <li> privacy.</li>
		                </ol>
                </ol>
                <br>
            3. This [draft] Standard also requires an explanation of how such impacts, as well as the undertaking’s dependencies on its own workforce, can create material risks or opportunities for the undertaking. For example, on the matter of equal opportunities, discrimination in hiring and promotion against women can reduce the undertaking’s access to qualified labour and harm its reputation. Conversely, policies to increase the representation of women in the workforce and in upper levels of management can have positive effects, such as increasing the pool of qualified labour and improving the undertaking’s reputation.<br><br>
            4. This [draft] Standard covers an undertaking’s “own workforce”, which is understood to include both workers who are in an employment relationship with the undertaking (“employees”) and non-employee workers who are either individuals with contracts with the undertaking to supply labour (“self-employed workers”) or workers provided by undertakings primarily engaged in “employment activities” (NACE Code N78). See Application Requirement 3 for examples of whofalls under own workforce.<br><br>
            5. This [draft] Standard does not cover workers in the undertaking’s upstream or downstreamvalue chain; these categories of workers are covered in ESRS S2 Workers in the value chain.<br><br>
            6. The [draft] Standard requires undertakings to describe their own workforce, including key characteristics of the employees and non-employee workers that are part of it. This description provides users with an understanding of the structure of the undertaking’s own workforce and helps to contextualise information provided through other disclosures.<br><br>
            7. The terms “own workforce” and “own workers” are used interchangeably in this [draft] Standard.<br><br>
            8. The objective of the [draft] Standard is also to ensure that the reporting requirements enable undertakings to disclose alignment with international and European human rights instruments and conventions, including the International Bill of Human Rights, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and ILO fundamental conventions, the UN Convention on Persons with Disabilities, the European Convention of Human Rights, the revised European Social Charter, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the EU policy priorities as set out by the European Pillar of Social Rights, and EU legislation, including the EU labour law acquis, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation and the EU Benchmark Regulation.<br><br>

		AR 27. In fulfilling the requirements set out by the disclosure criteria of Disclosure Requirement ESRS S1-3, the undertaking may be guided by the content of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct focused on remediation and grievance mechanisms.<br><br>
        AR 28. Channels for raising concerns or needs include grievance mechanisms, hotlines, trade unions (where workers are unionised), works councils, dialogue processes or other means through which own workers or workers’ representatives can raise concerns about impacts or explain needs that they would like the undertaking to address. This could include both channels provided by the undertaking directly and channels provided by the entities where their own workers are working and are to be reported in addition to any other mechanisms an undertaking may use to gain insight into the management of impacts on workers, such as compliance audits. Where the undertaking is relying solely on information about the existence of such channels provided by its business relationships to answer this requirement, it may state that.<br><br>
        AR 29. Third party mechanisms could include those operated by the government, NGOs, industry associations and other collaborative initiatives. With regard to the scope of these mechanisms, the undertaking may disclose whether these are accessible to all own workers who may be potentially or actually materially impacted by the undertaking (or workers’ representatives or, in their absence, individuals or organisations acting on their behalf or who are otherwise in a position to be aware of negative impacts), through which its own workforce (or workers’ representatives or, in their absence, individuals or organisations acting on their behalf or who are otherwise in a position to be aware of negative impacts), can raise complaints or concerns related to the undertaking’s own activities.<br><br>
        AR 30. The undertaking shall consider whether and how own workers that may be affected and their workers' representatives are able to access channels at the level of the undertaking they are employed by, or contracted to work for, in relation to each material impact. Relevant channels may include hotlines, trade unions (where workers are unionised) or works councils, or other grievance mechanisms operated by the relevant undertaking or by a third party.<br><br>
        AR 31. In explaining whether and how the undertaking knows that own workers are aware of and trust any of these channels, the undertaking may provide relevant and reliable data about the effectiveness of these channels from the perspective of own workers themselves. Examples of sources of information are surveys of workers that have used such channels and their levels of satisfaction with the process and outcomes.<br><br>
        AR 32. In describing the effectiveness of channels for own workers and workers’ representatives to raise concerns, the undertaking may be guided by the following questions, based on the “effectiveness criteria for non-judicial grievance mechanisms”, as laid out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The considerations below may be applied to individual channels or to a collective system of channels:
		<ol class="slds-list--ordered">
           <li> do the channels have legitimacy by providing appropriate accountability for their fair conduct and building stakeholder trust?</li>
           <li> are the channels known and accessible to stakeholders?</li>
           <li> do the channels have clear and known procedures, with indicative timeframes?</li>
           <li> do the channels ensure reasonable access for stakeholders to sources of information, advice and expertise?</li>
           <li> do the channels offer transparency by providing sufficient information both to complainants and, where applicable, to meet any public interest?</li>
           <li> do outcomes achieved through the channels accord with internationally recognised human rights?</li>
           <li> does the undertaking identify insights from the channels that support continuous learning in both improving the channels and preventing future impacts?</li>
           <li> does the undertaking focus on dialogue with complainants as the means to reach agreed solutions, rather than seeking to unilaterally determine the outcome?</li>

           <li> its aims for continued improvement.</li>
		</ol>
		<br>
        AR 34. Appropriate action can vary according to whether the undertaking causes or contributes to a material impact, or whether it is involved because the impact is directly linked to its operations, products or services by a business relationship.<br><br>
        AR 35. Given that material negative impacts affecting own workers that have occurred during the reporting period may not be caused or contributed to by the undertaking alone and may be linked to entities or operations outside its direct control, the undertaking may disclose whether and how it seeks to use its leverage with relevant business relationships to manage those impacts. This may include using commercial leverage (for example, enforcing contractual requirements with business relationships or implementing incentives), other forms of leverage within the relationship (such as providing training or capacity-building on workers’ rights to business relationships) or collaborative leverage with peers or other actors (such as initiatives aimed at responsible recruitment or ensuring workers receive a living wage).<br><br>
        AR 36. When the undertaking discloses its participation in an industry or multi-stakeholder initiative as part of its actions to address material negative impacts, the undertaking may disclose how the initiative, and its own involvement, is aiming to address the material impact concerned. It may report under ESRS S1-5 the relevant targets set by the initiative and progress towards them.<br><br>
        AR 37. When disclosing whether and how the undertaking considers actual and potential impacts on own workers in decisions to terminate business relationships and whether and how it seeks to address any negative impacts that may result from termination, the undertaking may include examples<br><br>
        AR 38. Processes used to track the effectiveness of actions can include internal or external auditing or verification, court proceedings and/or related court decisions, impact assessments, measurement systems, stakeholder feedback, grievance mechanisms, external performance ratings, and benchmarking.<br><br>
        AR 39. Reporting on effectiveness is aimed at enabling the understanding of the links between actions taken by an undertaking and the effective management of impacts. Additional information that the undertaking may provide includes data showing a decrease in the number of incidents identified.<br><br>
        AR 40. With regard to initiatives or processes whose primary aim is to deliver positive impacts for the undertaking’s own workforce that are based on affected workers’ needs and their level of implementation, the undertaking may disclose:
		<ol class="slds-list--ordered">
           <li> information about whether and how own workers and workers’ representatives play a role in decisions regarding the design and implementation of these programmes or processes; and</li>

		</ol>
		<br>
        AR 41. The undertaking may explain whether any such initiatives are designed also to support the achievement of one or more Sustainable Development Goals. For example, an undertaking committing to SDG 8 to “promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all” may be actively working towards eliminating forced or compulsory labour or supporting higher levels of productivity on activities in developing countries through technological upgrades and training of local labour, which can benefit both the specific own workers targeted by the actions, but also their local communities.<br><br>
        AR 42. When disclosing the intended or achieved positive outcomes of its actions for own workers a distinction is to be made between evidence of certain activities having occurred (for example, that x number of workers have received financial literacy training) from evidence of actual outcomes for workers (for example, that x workers report that they are able to better manage their household budgets so as to meet their savings goals).<br><br>
        AR 43. In the case of impacts on own workforce that arise from the transition to a greener, climateneutral economy, the undertaking shall consider disclosing information on any measures taken to mitigate negative impacts, such as training and reskilling, employment guarantees, and in the case of downscaling or mass dismissal, measures such as job counselling, coaching, intra-company placements and early retirement plans. This includes measures to comply with prevailing regulation. In taking action, companies may draw on resources such as the UN Global Compact Guidance on Just Transition for Business, which builds on the ILO’s Guidelines for a just transition towards environmentally sustainable economies and societies for all. The undertaking shall highlight present and/or expected external developments that influence whether dependencies turn into risks. This includes consideration of impacts that may arise from the transition to greener and climate-neutral operations.<br><br>
        AR 44. When disclosing the material risks and opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts or dependencies on own workers, the undertaking may consider the following business risks that could lead to risks:
		<ol class="slds-list--ordered">
           <li> business risks related to the undertaking’s impacts on its own workers may include the reputational or legal exposure where workers are found to be subject to forced or child labour;</li>
           <li> business risks related to the undertaking’s dependencies on its own workers may include the loss of business continuity where significant employee turnover or lack of skills/training development threaten the undertaking’s business; and</li>
           <li> business opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts on its own workers may include market differentiation and greater customer appeal from guaranteeing decent pay and conditions for its gig workers.</li>
		</ol>
		<br>
        AR 45. When explaining whether dependencies turn into risks, the undertaking shall consider external developments.<br><br>
        AR 46. When disclosing policies, action and resources and targets related to the management of material risks and opportunities, in cases where risks and opportunities arise from a material impact, the undertaking may cross-reference its disclosures on policies, action and resources and targets in relation to that impact.<br><br>

           <li> the intended outcomes to be achieved in the lives of a certain number of own workers;</li>
           <li> that these are measurable/verifiable;</li>

        AR 50. Targets related to risks and opportunities may be the same as or distinct from targets tied to impacts. Therefore, no distinction is to be made per se, but what the target is aiming at is to be disclosed (i.e., impact and/or risks and opportunities). For example, a target to reach adequate wages for non-employee workers could both reduce impacts on those workers and reduce associated business risks in terms of the quality and reliability of their output.<br><br>
        AR 51. The undertaking may also distinguish between short, medium and long-term targets covering the same policy commitment. For example, the undertaking may have a long-term target to achieve an 80% reduction in health and safety incidents affecting its delivery drivers by 2030 and a near-term target to reduce the overtime hours of delivery drivers by x% while maintaining their income by 2024.<br><br>
        AR 52. When modifying or replacing a target in the reporting period, the undertaking may explain the change by cross-referencing it to significant changes in the business model(s) or to broader changes in the accepted standard or legislation from which the target is derived to provide contextual information as per ESRS 2 BP-2 Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances.<br><br>

        AR 56. The definitions of permanent, temporary, non-guaranteed hours, full-time, and part-time employees differ between countries. If the undertaking has employees in more than one country, it shall use the definitions as per the national laws of the countries where the employees are based to calculate country-level data. The country-level data shall then be added up to calculate total numbers, disregarding differences in national legal definitions. Nonguaranteed hours employees are employed by the undertaking without a guarantee of a minimum or fixed number of working hours. The employee may need to make themselves available for work as required, but the undertaking is not contractually obligated to offer the employee a minimum or fixed number of working hours per day, week, or month. Casual employees, employees with zero-hour contracts, and on-call employees are examples that fall under this category.<br><br>
        AR 57. Reporting the number of employees at the end of the reporting period provides information for that point in time, without capturing fluctuations during the reporting period. Reporting these numbers in averages across the reporting period takes into account fluctuations during the reporting period.<br><br>
        AR 58. Quantitative data, such as the number of temporary or part-time employees, is unlikely to be sufficient on its own. For example, a high proportion of temporary or part-time employees could indicate a lack of employment security for employees, but it could equally signal workplace flexibility when offered as a voluntary choice. For this reason, the undertaking is required to disclose contextual information to help information users interpret the data. The undertaking can explain the reasons for temporary employment. An example of such a reason is the recruitment of employees to undertake work on a temporary or seasonal project or event. Another example is the standard practice to offer a temporary contract (for example, six months) to new employees before an offer of permanent employment is made. The undertaking may also explain the reasons for non-guaranteed hours employment.<br><br>
        AR 59. For the own employee turnover calculation, the undertaking shall calculate the aggregate of the number of employees who leave voluntarily or due to dismissal, retirement, or death in service. The undertaking shall use this number for the numerator of the employee turnover rate and may determine the denominator used to calculate this rate and describe its methodology.<br><br>
        AR 60. Where data is not available for detailed information, the undertaking shall use an estimation of the employee number or ratios, in accordance with ESRS 1, and clearly identify where the use of estimates has taken place.<br><br>

		AR 61. This Disclosure Requirement provides insight into the undertaking’s approach to employment, as well as the scope and nature of impacts arising from its employment practices. It also provides contextual information that aids an understanding of the information reported in other disclosures. This disclosure covers both individual contractors supplying labour to the undertaking (“self-employed workers”) and workers provided by undertakings primarily engaged in “employment activities” (NACE Code N78). If all the workers performing work for the undertaking are employees and the undertaking does not have any workers who are not employees, this Disclosure Requirement is not material for the undertaking; notwithstanding, the undertaking may state this fact when disclosing the information required by Disclosure Requirement DR S1-6 as contextual information as this information can be relevant for the users of the Sustainability Statements.<br><br>
        AR 62. Examples of contractors (self-employed persons) in own workforce include: contractors hired by the undertaking to perform work that would otherwise be carried out by an employee; contractors hired by the undertaking to perform work in a public area (for example, on a road, on the street); and contractors hired by the undertaking to deliver the work/service directly at the workplace of a client of the organization. Examples of workers employed by a third party engaged in ‘employment activities’ whose work is under the direction of the undertaking include: workers who perform the same work that employees carry out, such as workers who fill in for employees who are temporarily absent (due to illness, holiday, parental leave, etc.); workers performing regular work at the same site as employees; and workers who are dispatched temporarily from another EU member state to work for the undertaking (‘posted workers’). Examples of value chain workers (and thus of workers not in own workforce and reported under the scope of ESRS S2) include: workers for a supplier contracted by the undertaking who work on the supplier’s premises using the supplier’s work methods; workers for a ‘downstream’ entity which purchases goods or services from the undertaking; and workers of an equipment supplier to the undertaking who, at one or more of the undertaking’s workplaces , perform regular maintenance on the supplier’s equipment (for example, photocopier) as stipulated in the contract between the equipment supplier and the undertaking.<br><br>
        AR 63. If the undertaking cannot report exact figures, it shall use estimates according to the provisions in ESRS 1 to disclose the number of workers who are not employees to the nearest ten or, where the number of workers who are not employees is greater than 1,000, to the nearest 100, and explain this. In addition, it shall clearly identify the information that derives from actual data and estimates.<br><br>
        AR 64. Reporting the number of workers in own workforce who are not employees at the end of the reporting period provides information for that point in time without capturing fluctuations during the reporting period. Reporting this number as an average across the reporting period considers fluctuations during the reporting period and can provide more insightful and relevant information for the users.<br><br>
        AR 65. The information disclosed by the undertaking allows stakeholders to understand how the number of non-employee workers in its own workforce varies during the reporting period or compared to the previous reporting period (i.e., whether the numbers have increased or decreased). It may also include the reasons for the fluctuations. For example, an increase in the number of non-employee workers in its own workforce during the reporting period could be due to a seasonal event. Conversely, a decrease in the number of non-employee workers in its own workforce compared to the previous reporting period could be due to the completion of a temporary project. It is the criteria of the undertaking to determine which fluctuations in the number of workers it considers significant to report and to describe its threshold for determining significant fluctuations. If there are no significant fluctuations in the number of non-employee workers in its own workforce during the reporting period or between the current and previous reporting period, the undertaking may disclose this information.<br><br>

This means that if none of the employees and non-employee workers in its own workforce are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the percentage reported is zero. An employee and non-employee worker in own workforce covered by more than one collective bargaining agreement only needs to be counted once.<br><br>
        AR 68. This requirement is not aimed at obtaining the percentage of employees represented by a works council or belonging to trade unions, which can be different. The percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can be higher than the percentage of unionised employees when the collective bargaining agreements apply to both union and non-union members. Alternatively, the percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can be lower than the percentage of unionised employees. This may be the case when there are no collective bargaining agreements available or when the collective bargaining agreements do not cover all unionised employees.<br><br>

For these countries it shall report the percentage of employees in that country which are employed in establishments in which employees are represented by workers’ representatives at the establishment level. Establishment is defined as any place of operations where the undertaking carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and goods. Examples include: a factory, a branch of a retail chain, or an undertaking’s headquarters.

        <b>Guidance on “work-related”</b><br><br>

		<ol class="slds-list--ordered">
           <li> a worker suffers a heart attack while at work that it is not connected with work;</li>

		</ol>
		<br>
        AR 86. With regard to travelling for work purposes, injuries and ill health that occur while a worker is travelling are work related if, at the time of the injury or ill health, the worker was engaged in work activities “in the interest of the employer”. Examples of such activities include travelling to and from customer contacts; conducting job tasks; and entertaining or being entertained to transact, discuss, or promote business (at the direction of the employer). If the undertaking is responsible for the transport commuting, incidents occurred while commuting are considered to be work-related. Nonetheless, incidents which arise during travel, outside of the undertaking’s responsibility (i.e. regular commuting to and from work), may be reported separately provided that the undertaking has such data available across the undertaking.<br><br>
        AR 87. With regard to working from home, injuries and ill health that occur when working from home are work related, if the injury or ill health occurs while the worker is performing work from home; and the injury or ill health is directly related to the performance of work rather than the general home environment or setting.<br><br>
        AR 88. With regard to mental illness, it is considered to be work related, if it has been notified voluntarily by the worker and it is supported by an opinion from a licensed healthcare professional with appropriate training and experience; and if such opinion states that the illness is work related.<br><br>
        AR 89. Health issues resulting, for example, from smoking, drug and alcohol abuse, physical inactivity, unhealthy diets, and psychosocial factors unrelated to work are not considered work-related.<br><br>
        AR 90. Occupational diseases are not considered work-related injuries but are covered under workrelated ill health.<br><br>
        <b>Guidance on computing the rate</b><br><br>
        AR 91. In computing the rate of work-related injuries, the undertaking shall divide the respective number of cases by the number of total hours worked by own workers and multiplied by 1,000,000. Thereby, these rates represent the number of respective cases per one million hours worked. A rate based on 1,000,000 hours worked indicates the number of work-related injuries per 500 full time workers over a one-year timeframe. For comparability purposes a rate of 1,000,000 hours worked shall be used also for undertakings with less than 500 workers.<br><br>
        AR 92. If the undertaking cannot directly calculate the number of hours worked, it may estimate this on the basis of normal or standard hours of work, taking into account entitlements to periods of paid leave of absence from work (for example, paid vacations, paid sick leave, public holidays) and explain this in its disclosures.<br><br>

        <b>Guidance on recordable work-related ill health</b><br><br>
        AR 94. Work-related ill health can include acute, recurring, and chronic health problems caused or aggravated by work conditions or practices. These include musculoskeletal disorders, skin and respiratory diseases, malignant cancers, diseases caused by physical agents (for example, noise induced hearing loss, vibration-caused diseases), and mental illnesses (for example, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder). For the purpose of the required disclosures, the undertaking shall, at a minimum, include in its disclosure those cases outlined in the ILO List of Occupational Diseases.<br><br>

        AR 104. To illustrate the contextual information, the undertaking may provide an explanation to understand the data and how the data has been compiled (methodology). Quantitative data, such as the annual total compensation ratio, may not be sufficient on its own to understand pay disparity and its drivers. For example, pay ratios can be influenced by the size of the undertaking (for example, revenue, number of employees), its sector, its employment strategy (for example, reliance on outsourced workers or part-time employees, a high degree of automation), or currency volatility.<br><br>

		<b>Discrimination incidents</b><br><br>
        AR 105. When compiling the information required related to corrective actions, the undertaking shall consider the following:
		<ol class="slds-list--ordered">
           <li> an incident is no longer subject to action if it is resolved, the case is completed, or no further action is required by the undertaking. For example, an incident for which no further action is required can include cases that are withdrawn or where the underlying circumstances that led to the incident no longer exist;</li>
           <li> remedial action is typically (and shall be) directed toward the alleged harasser and the alleged victim. Remedial action toward the victim may include offering to pay his/her expenses for counselling sessions, offering the victim some paid time off, offering to reinstate sick/vacation days if the victim has incurred any expenses due to the harassment (such as having used sick or vacation days); and</li>
           <li> remedial action toward the harasser may include giving the harasser a verbal and/or written warning, mandating anti-harassment counselling or sending the harasser to an appropriate seminar, harassment awareness and prevention training. A suspension without pay may also be an option. If the harasser has been disciplined earlier but his/her harassment does not cease, then more serious discipline may be required.</li>
		</ol>

        <b>Severe cases of human rights issues and incidents</b><br><br>
        AR 106. Severe human rights issues and incidents include instances of lawsuits, formal complaints through the undertaking or third-party complaint mechanisms, serious allegations in public reports or the media, where these are connected to the undertaking’s own workforce, and the fact of the incidents is not disputed by the undertaking, as well as any other severe impacts of which the undertaking is aware. Human trafficking is defined as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of people through force, fraud or deception, with the aim of exploiting them for profit. Confirmed incidents include incidents of child or forced labour or human trafficking that have been found to be substantiated. Confirmed incidents do not include incidents of child or forced labour or human trafficking that are still under investigation in the reporting period.<br><br>
