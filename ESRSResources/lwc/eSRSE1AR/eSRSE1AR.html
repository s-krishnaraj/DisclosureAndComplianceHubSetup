        AR 1. A transition plan relates to the undertaking’s efforts in climate change mitigation. When disclosing its transition plan, the undertaking is expected to provide a high-level explanation of how it will adjust its strategy and business model to ensure compatibility with the transition to a sustainable economy and with the limiting of global warming to 1.5°C in line with the Paris Agreement (or an updated international agreement on climate change) and the objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 with no or limited overshoot as established in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 (European Climate Law), and where applicable, its exposure to coal, and oil and gas-related activities. <br><br>

        AR 29. The reference target value is dependent on the base year and baseline emissions of the undertaking’s GHG emission reduction target. As a result, the reference target value for undertakings with a recent base year or from higher baseline emissions may be less stringent than it will be for undertakings that already have taken ambitious past actions to reduce GHG emissions. Therefore, undertakings that have in the past achieved GHG emissions reductions in line with either a 1.5°C-aligned cross-sector or sector-specific pathway, may adjust their baseline emissions accordingly to determine the reference target value. Accordingly, if the undertaking is adjusting the baseline emissions to determine the reference target value, it shall not consider GHG emission reductions that precede the year 2020 and it shall provide appropriate evidence of its past achieved GHG emission reduction.<br><br>

    <b>Potential financial effects from material physical and transition risks</b><br><br>

    AR 65. Material climate-related physical and transition risks may affect the undertaking’s financial position (e.g., owned assets, financially-controlled leased assets, and liabilities), performance (e.g., potential future increase/decrease in net revenue and costs due to business interruptions, increased supply prices resulting in potential margin erosions), and cash flows. The low probability, high severity and long-term time horizons of some climaterelated physical risk exposures and the uncertainty arising from the transition to a sustainable economy mean that there will be associated material potential financial effects that are outside the scope of the requirements of existing accounting standards.<br><br>
